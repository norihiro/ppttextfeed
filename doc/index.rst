Slide Text Bridge
=================

Welcome to ``slidetextbridge``!
This tool acts as a bridge,
sending presentation text from sources like Microsoft PowerPoint to live-streaming software such as OBS Studio.
This allows you to update on-screen text overlays in your live streams directly from your presentation notes or slides.

This document will guide you through the initial setup and provide a comprehensive reference for the configuration file.
